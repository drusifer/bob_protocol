# Cypher Context

**Current Focus**: Sprint Management - Service Layer Extraction

**Active Sprint**: Service Layer Extraction
- **Goal**: Eliminate code duplication between CLI and TUI
- **Status**: ~40% Complete - Implementation done, integration pending
- **Key Deliverables**: TagDiagnosticsService (✅), TagMaintenanceService (❌)

**Sprint Status** (2025-11-28):
- **US-1**: 60% (Service implemented, TUI integration pending)
- **US-2**: 0% (Not started, waiting on design)
- **US-3**: 50% (Pattern established, migration incomplete)

**Blockers Identified**:
1. TUI screens still use old command pattern (TagStatusCommand, ReadTagCommand)
2. TagMaintenanceService not designed yet
3. Neo status unclear (stopped per state file)

**Recent Decisions**:
- Formalized sprint structure with User Stories and Acceptance Criteria
- Established Definition of Done aligned with quality standards
- Identified architectural debt: TUI commands duplicating tool logic
- Compiled comprehensive status report for team visibility
