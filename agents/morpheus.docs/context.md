# Morpheus - Current Context

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-27 22:29

## Recent Decisions
- **Architecture Correction**: Confirmed TUI (Textual) is correct, NOT Pygame
- Pygame code deleted, focusing on TUI integration
- **ToolRunner Assessment**: Identified API mismatches, recommended TUI direct integration

## Key Files Being Worked On
- `src/ntag424_sdm_provisioner/tools/runner.py` (needs API updates)
- `src/ntag424_sdm_provisioner/tui/screens/provision.py`
- `src/ntag424_sdm_provisioner/services/provisioning_service.py`

## Active Decisions
- ToolRunner uses old `.execute()` API (needs card.send())
- TUI doesn't need ToolRunner - can call ProvisioningService directly
- Recommended bypassing ToolRunner for TUI integration

## Team Dependencies
- Awaiting Drew's decision: Fix ToolRunner first, or TUI direct integration?
- Neo ready for either path
- Trin monitoring test health

## Notes
TUI already has WorkerManager, Clock, Command pattern - solid foundation exists.
