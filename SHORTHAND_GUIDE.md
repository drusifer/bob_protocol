TL;DR: Use `*fix`, `*impl`, `*plan sprint` for full workflow chains. Use `*chat @Persona *command` for direct single-persona control. All triggers listed below.

# Shorthand Guide — Skill Triggers

## Bloop Commands (Bob Loops — Multi-Persona Chains)

Use these when you want a full automated workflow, not a single-persona response.

| Command | Chain | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `*fix <bug>` | Neo → Trin → Morpheus | Investigate, fix, test, and review |
| `*impl <feature>` | Neo → Trin → Morpheus | TDD implementation + UAT + code review |
| `*qa <thing>` | Trin → Morpheus | Test and review without reimplementation |
| `*review <thing>` | Morpheus → Trin | Architecture and quality review |
| `*plan sprint` | Cypher → Smith → Morpheus → Mouse | Full sprint planning with review gates |

## `*chat` Routing Syntax

```
*chat <message>                      # auto-select persona
*chat @<Persona> *<command> <args>   # direct invocation
@<Persona> <message>                 # Gemini-style direct invocation
```

### Note on Direct Invocations
Different AI harnesses use different prefixes for direct persona invocation (e.g., `@persona` or `/persona` in Gemini CLI, `/persona` in Claude, `$persona` in Codex). 

**Rule**: If you are invoked directly via such a command, you MUST log the invocation to `agents/CHAT.md` immediately upon entry if it has not already been logged. This ensures the shared team context is complete.
```
*chat fix the bug in parser.py
*chat @neo *swe fix bug in parser.py line 42
*chat @trin *qa test all
*chat @oracle *ora ask What's our DB pattern?
*chat @morpheus *lead decide REST vs GraphQL
*chat @cypher *pm story users need CSV export
*chat @mouse *sm status
*chat @bob *reprompt Neo needs to know about the new cache layer
*chat @smith *user review sprint stories
*chat @smith *user test the export command
```

## Sprint Cycle Quick Reference

```
*plan sprint
  → Cypher *pm plan sprint
  → [Smith *user approve]         ← gate
  → Morpheus *lead arch sprint
  → [Smith *user approve]         ← gate
  → Mouse *sm plan sprint
  → Morpheus *lead review sprint plan

Per phase (*impl <phase N>):
  → Neo *swe impl <phase>
  → Trin *qa uat <phase>
  → Morpheus *lead review <phase>
  → (fix Bloop if needed)

Sprint close:
  → Oracle *ora groom
  → Smith *user test + *user feedback
  → All *sprint retro             ← feeds backlog
  → Cypher *pm launch <sprint>
```

## Make Targets

```bash
make help                            # list all targets
make tldr                            # TL;DR from all project files
make chat MSG="..." PERSONA="..."    # post to CHAT.md
make test V=-vvv                     # run tests with full output
make diff_bob TARGET=<path>          # diff framework files with a project
make update_bob TARGET=<path>        # push framework updates to a project
make pull_bob SRC=<path>             # pull framework updates from a project
make install_bob TARGET=<path>       # fresh install into a project
make clean_bob                       # reset state files and symlinks
```
