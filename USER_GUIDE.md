# User Guide: The Persona-as-a-Service (PaaS) System

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the new Persona-as-a-Service (PaaS) architecture. The Bob Protocol has evolved. Instead of having a single agent that switches between different roles, each persona (Morpheus, Neo, Trin, etc.) is now a dedicated, command-driven **MCP Service**.

This makes the system more predictable, reliable, and powerful. You no longer have conversations to coax a persona into action; you directly command a specialized service to perform a task.

## 2. Core Concept: From Chat to Commands

The old `*chat` workflow is now deprecated. To interact with the system, you invoke a persona's commands directly using the MCP tool pattern.

**The command structure is:**
`mcp__<persona_name>__<command> [parameters...]`

For example, to ask the Oracle a question, you would use:
`mcp__oracle__ask question="What is the established pattern for TUI development?"`

### Shorthand Aliases
To make commands easier to type, a set of shorthands is available (e.g., `morph plan` instead of the full `mcp__morpheus__plan` command).

**A full list of these aliases is available in the [SHORTHAND_GUIDE.md](SHORTHAND_GUIDE.md).**

## 3. The Persona Services

Each persona from the original Bob Protocol is now a dedicated service with a specific set of commands.

| Persona | Service Name | Purpose | Command Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Morpheus** | `mcp__morpheus` | Architecture, Planning, & Leadership | [morpheus_mcp.md](./agents/tools/morpheus_mcp.md) |
| **Neo** | `mcp__neo` | Software Implementation & Bug Fixing | [neo_mcp.md](./agents/tools/neo_mcp.md) |
| **Trin** | `mcp__trin` | Quality Assurance & Verification | [trin_mcp.md](./agents/tools/trin_mcp.md) |
| **Oracle** | `mcp__oracle` | Knowledge Management & Documentation | [oracle_mcp.md](./agents/tools/oracle_mcp.md) |
| **Cypher**| `mcp__cypher` | Product Requirements & User Stories | [cypher_mcp.md](./agents/tools/cypher_mcp.md) |
| **Mouse** | `mcp__mouse` | Sprint & Task Management | [mouse_mcp.md](./agents/tools/mouse_mcp.md) |
| **Bob** | `mcp__bob` | System Configuration & Metaprogramming | [bob_mcp.md](./agents/tools/bob_mcp.md) |

To see the full list of commands and parameters for any service, please refer to its `_mcp.md` documentation file linked above.

## 4. Example Workflow: Developing a New Feature

Here’s how you might use the services in concert to take a feature from idea to completion.

### Step 1: Define the Feature
First, use the **Cypher** service to formally define the feature request.

`mcp__cypher__define_feature request="Users need a button on the main screen that shows the tag's UID."`

### Step 2: Create an Implementation Plan
Next, ask the **Morpheus** service to create a technical plan for the user stories generated by Cypher.

`mcp__morpheus__plan story="US-124: As a user, I can press a button to view the tag's UID."`

### Step 3: Implement the Feature
With a clear plan, delegate the implementation work to the **Neo** service.

`mcp__neo__implement task="Implement a 'Show UID' button on the main TUI screen as per the plan."`

### Step 4: Verify the Feature
Once Neo has completed the implementation, use the **Trin** service to verify that it works as expected and meets the acceptance criteria.

`mcp__trin__verify feature="US-124: Show UID Button" acceptance_criteria="When pressed, the button displays the correct UID and does not crash."`

### Step 5: Record the Work
Finally, you can ask the **Oracle** to record the decision and the **Mouse** service to update the sprint board.

`mcp__oracle__record decision="The 'Show UID' feature was implemented using a non-blocking worker thread."`
`mcp__mouse__update_task task_id="T-45" new_status="done"`

This demonstrates how you can chain the services together to create powerful, automated workflows that are driven by direct commands.
